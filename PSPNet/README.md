# PSPNet_tensorflow
## Introduction
  This is an implementation of PSPNet in TensorFlow from https://github.com/hellochick/PSPNet-tensorflow for semantic segmentation on the [cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) dataset.

## Install
Get restore checkpoint from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9CKOTmy0DyaV09LajlTa0Z2WFU) and put into `model` directory.

## Experiments
We use this to segment virtual images when applying our agent on unsegmented tracks. And we use it to segment images of real driving data.
